Made this display to keep my motivation up. It displays a total distance of all of my activities on Strava.

The code is running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W that is connected to Micro Dot pHAT. Micro Dot pHAT is an unashamedly old school LED matrix display board, with up to 30x7 pixels, using the Lite-On LTP-305 matrices. Perfect for building a retro scrolling message display or a tiny 30 band spectrum analyser.
